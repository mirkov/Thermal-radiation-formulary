	* thermal-radiation-formulary.asd (thermal-radiation-formulary):
	Renamed view-radiation module into spectral-calculations

	* disk+ring-view-factors.lisp (f1-2-parallel-coaxial-equal-disks)
	(f1-2-parallel-coaxial-unequal-disks)
	(f1-2-parallel-coaxial-disk&ring, f1-2-parallel-coaxial-rings):
	Changed arguments to those of the radiation catalogue.  Added
	formulas for areas, and modified return values to return them

	* thermal-radiation-formulary.asd (thermal-radiation-formulary):
	Modified to load rectangular and inner cylinder surfaces view
	factors

	* rectangular-area-view-factors.lisp: Modified all functions to
	return areas

	* utilities.lisp: Replaced many of the macro definitions as
	functions: ^0.25 ^4 C->K K->C st4.
	(sigma*T^4): Renamed st4 into sigma*T^4.  Replaced its invocations
	at other places in the code.

	* inner-cylinder-surfaces-view-factors.lisp: New file for view
	factors between inner surfaces of a cylinder

	* view-factors.lisp: Removed view factors between inner surfaces
	of a cylinder (C79-85) into separate file

	* thermal-radiation-formulary-unit-tests.lisp
	(parallel-plate-equilibrium-sigma#1)
	(parallel-plate-equilibrium-sigma=1): Replaced `(assert-equals
	#'epsilon-equal ...)'  with `(let ((*epsilon*
	...)) (assert-number-equal ...))' and adjusted *epsilon*

	* radiation.lisp: Replaced `(assert-equals #'epsilon-equal ...)'
	with `(let ((*epsilon* ...)) (assert-number-equal ...))' and
	adjusted *epsilon*

	* view-factors.lisp (F1-2-perpendicular-rectangles-with-common-edge):
	Improved documentation.
